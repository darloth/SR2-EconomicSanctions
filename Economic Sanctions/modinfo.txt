	Name: Economic Sanctions
	Description: <<
		Haven't you ever wanted to be the commissioner of the senate imposing crippling economic sanctions on those who flaunt the decisions of the council? Now you can!

		Prevaricate to delay votes
		More influence based shenanigans!
		New! More trade, so you can sanction harder!
		Reusable, no-bonus Rename cards, so that you can name everything you want at no extra cost!
		Reusable yet suboptimal vote weight cards - never be stuck without a negotiate-equivalent again (though you're going to really regret overusing these.  They're basically last resorts.)
		Special researchable abilities! (one thereof).
		Super-secret rare trolling opportunities. (Nothing too terrible, but what if you could name things you didn't own?)
